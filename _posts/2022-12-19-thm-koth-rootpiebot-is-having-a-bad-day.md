<p>TLDR; Don't cheat at KoTH and life will be easier (<em>at least when I'm involved</em>)...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>User&nbsp;<strong>"rootpiebot"</strong> on TryHackMe King of the Hill is a known cheating dbag...</p>
<p>Caught him in the act destroying machines, both with <em><strong>forkbombs</strong></em><em> and simple&nbsp;<strong>rm -rf&nbsp;</strong></em> to kill machines and try to maintain his lead.</p>
<p>He does this&nbsp;<em><strong>every damn game!&nbsp;</strong></em></p>
<p>Trying to teach him a lesson, I nearly crawled my way back (through bogged down&nbsp;<strong>Hogwarts</strong> game thanks to forkbombs lol)</p>

<p>Oh shucks, so close! Better luck next time <em>(</em><em>or at least that's how games and sportsmanship are supposed to work)</em></p>
<p>But no ... As the night continues...</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">So this kept happening ...</h2>

<p>Spamming resets is the worst rule to break, and he did it in spectacular fasion.</p>
<p>It is immature, ignorant, and even less fun than trying to recover from forkbomb or rm -rf / destroyed boxes.</p>

<pre>Dear&nbsp;<em><strong>@rootpiebot</strong></em>,<br /><br />Please GROW THE FUCK UP or DO NOT PLAY.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br /><br />Every KoTH player</pre>
